          <h1>Profit Planning <b>On Steroids</b></h1>
          <p>Creating a step-by-step plan for your Interactive Offer is probably easier than you think, but it does require some planning. In this course, you'll get access to specific examples of different types of Interactive Offers. This isn't a bunch of theory . . . it's high impact, it's fast paced, and it's all about getting solid results.</p>
          <p>I am going to work with you to build a list. Your list can start off small but like a tiny seed, this seed can grow into a huge tree because of all the attention, excitement and interaction that you've created during your Interactive Offer. If you already have a nice list . . . cool. But everyone could use a bigger and more responsive list and I am going to show you the fastest, most effective way I know to do this and it does not involve pay-per-click, SEO or blogging your brains out. </p>
          <p>I'll show you how to build the rock solid trust that will be the basis and bedrock for getting your customers to invest in your programs and products before you make them. This module lays the foundation upon which the rest of your Interactive Offer depends. You'll learn how to make your content, your story, and your message more engaging and suspenseful than your favorite guilty pleasure novel . . . even if you suck at selling and even if you can't write copy to save your life.</p>
          <p>In this course, I'll show you how to get your list to tell to you - in explicit terms - every last detail of the product that they've been waiting to buy from you. You'll also learn how to get your list to write your Interactive Offer sales letter or sales video for you.</p>
          <h1>Crafting Your <b>Interactive Offer</b></h1>
          <p>I'm going to show you how to craft and structure your presell offer for maximum profit and value. The way you create and structure your offer for a product that you haven't created yet is very different from offering a pre-made product. And I am going to meticulously show you every last detail of how to create a product offering that people are willing to "pre-buy" (before it's made).</p>
